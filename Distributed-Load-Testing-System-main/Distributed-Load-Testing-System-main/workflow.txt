Frontend API for Tsunami Test:

When you select the Tsunami test from the frontend, the API sends a test configuration (test_config) to the Kafka topic (topic_test_config) that includes test_id, test_type, and test_delay.
Trigger from Orchestrator:

The orchestrator also sends a trigger to the driver nodes through the trigger topic (topic_trigger) after receiving the tsunami API call.
Driver Node Consumes Test Config and Trigger:

The driver nodes are consuming messages from the Kafka topics topic_test_config and topic_trigger.
Driver Checks Config:

The driver node processes the test_config, matching the parameters like test_type (in this case, "TSUNAMI") and delay.
Run Tsunami Test Logic:

Since it’s a tsunami test, the driver runs the code for the Tsunami test, which sends repeated GET requests to the target server.
Setting Up Driver Node (Command Arguments):

When you run the driver node using python3 driver.py kafka_ip orchestrator_ip target_ip, the driver stores these command-line arguments to send metrics and heartbeats to the correct Kafka broker and orchestrator.
Driver Node Initialization:

The driver node assigns itself an ID. The Kafka producer and consumer are initialized; the producer is connected to port 9092 (Kafka broker), and the consumer subscribes to topic_test_config and topic_trigger. store_test is initialized to track metrics.
Tsunami Test Execution:

In the Tsunami test, a for loop runs to send requests to the specified target URL, collecting metrics (latency, success, failure, etc.), and updates store_test with this data.
Heartbeat Thread Running in Background:

Simultaneously, another thread in the driver node is sending heartbeats at regular intervals to the orchestrator through the heartbeat topic.
Back to Orchestrator Node:

The orchestrator is managing the entire process and communicating with driver nodes.
Register Driver Node:

When a driver node starts (python3 driver.py ...), it registers itself with the orchestrator by sending its information (like ID and IP) to the orchestrator, which updates the list of active nodes.
Heartbeat Function in Orchestrator:

The orchestrator receives heartbeats from driver nodes, indicating they are still active and online.
Update Metrics:

The orchestrator listens to the topic_metrics and updates its internal metrics store for each test, tracking data like request times, success, and failure rates.
Orchestrator Threads in Background:

Two key threads run in parallel on the orchestrator node:
Kafka Consumer Thread: Consumes messages from topics related to heartbeat, metrics, and driver registration.
Driver Status Update Thread: Checks for driver nodes that haven’t sent a heartbeat in a specified time interval (e.g., 5 seconds) and marks those nodes as "DOWN."
Summary:
Your explanation was correct. The key sequence involves drivers consuming test_config and trigger, running the appropriate test (Tsunami), sending metrics, and heartbeats while the orchestrator manages these processes through Kafka topics and background threads.
